# Rotation Helper – Frontend (MVP)

Currently a very simple frontend. It includes basic HTML pages for user registration and login. There is no backend connection yet — will be added later.

## Pages Included
- **index.html** – Homepage with links to Register and Login.
- **register.html** – Form where a user enters their name, Minerva email, password, and selects a rotation city.
- **login.html** – Form where a user enters their email and password.
- **success.html** – A simple confirmation page that appears after submitting a form.
- **styles.css** – Basic styling shared across all pages.

## Features
- Simple HTML forms (name, email, password, dropdown menu).
- Minerva-only email restriction using a basic HTML pattern.
- Navigation between pages using regular `<a>` links.
- Very basic CSS for spacing, fonts, and button style.
- No JavaScript, no backend, no advanced frameworks yet.
